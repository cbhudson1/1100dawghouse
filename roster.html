                    <div class="roster">
                        <p class="name">Ethan "Penny" Pennington</p>
                        <p class="info">Unit 1 / 5'10" / 145</p>
                        <p class="text">Pennington is definitely a fun one to be around and always makes sure to incorporate some mischief into the plans, yet it can be hard to locate him sometimes. He will regularly make the dash to stay elsewhere for the night, but can always provide an easy FIFA win for you or Microsoft Flight Simulator advice. Other than "Penny", he is known by the nickname: Master P.</p>

                    <div class="roster">
                        <p class="name">Lucas "Burger" Epstein</p>
                        <p class="info">Unit 2 / 5'7" / 163</p>
                        <p class="text">A man of many nicknames, "Burger" or "Big Drip" is a staple to the 1100 group. He may occasionally ask some pretty out-of-left-field questions or you might smell his impossible meat being cooked down the hall, but Epstein will always provide a good laugh (sometimes he may be faking it) and a serious, deep passion for Lebron James.</p>

                        <p class="name">Charlie "Pill-Bottle" Pillsbury</p>
                        <p class="info">Unit 2 / 6'4" / 171</p>
                        <p class="text">Known as the Duke of Cornball around the confines of 1100, Pillsbury is consistently looking to crack a dad joke or say something punny to the pleasure of his housemates, which find it rather, dry. He is known for playing Civ or Clash, and will want every chance to tell you that you aren't an elder in Clash of Clans.</p>

                        <p class="info">Unit 3/ 5'10" / 159</p>
                        <p class="text">You can never find Duffy up to something that is not out of the ordinary. Whether he is playing a tune in his makeshift studio, telling you about his pet gecko, Steve, or getting away with things against his will, Duffy typically creates some noise or ripples throughout the house. Also is known to strum a better harmony than Nash Grier on the guitar.</p>

                        <p class="info">Unit 4 / 6'0" / 190</p>
                        <p class="text">Whether he is taking on a final boss assignment that is two months overdue or figuring out a manuever to work his way out of a jam, Ciccone is simply looking to live by simple words: be here now and do stuff. A big fan of sleep and an even bigger fan of the New York Mets, ole Bobby Boy is constantly striving to have a good time wherever he goes. Live like Bobby.</p>

                        <p class="info">Unit 4 / 5'7" / 135</p>
                        <p class="text">Hard to top him, the kid is known for being a wizard and always has some content to relate back to whatever you may be talking about. He is a core riddler and at certain times, may pull off some of the most mind-blowing feats that leave you in awe. Don't be too amazed, as this man can usually be found passed out on the jouch at practically any time of day.</p>

                        <p class="info">Unit 5 / 5'5" / 138</p>
                        <p class="text">He may be the shortest out of the herd, but J-Roc never backs down from a fight. He can be seen grinding programming projects, telling someone about why his fold was the right call in poker, or saying he is the dog in this mud. Jevin will let his point be known, but you can also expect some wise saying associated with it that may take your attention at that time. </p>

                        <p class="info">Unit 6 / 6'0" / 170</p>
                        <p class="text">He's a chiller and probably the most quiet Rocket League master you will ever meet. In only five minutes of real time, you will be shocked by the way this RL-Messi can keep the ball on his digital car. He takes a lot of pride in his Mariners and loves Panera brand chips as well.</p>

                        <p class="info">Unit 6 / 6'3" / 193</p>
                        <p class="text">This man loves quality works in the realm of pop-culture and won't be afraid to express his love for the finest developments of art. Nevertheless, Stothoff is a man on a mission: looking to revolutionize how the workplace is understood, from an evolutionary point of view. He is known for a plethora of cigars, PB&J's and promoting the best of John Deere. </p>

                        <p class="text">There are times where if you come to 1100, you will see someone stuck in the Roose-hole. Roose knows anything about every movie imaginable, runs a top-notch wagering service and takes his Madden skills very seriously. Keep an eye on Roose, he may snag something without you knowing, but he can always provide great content to any situation. P.S. don't let him near someone threatening. </p>

                        <p class="text">You've reached the last man of the team, Chudster. This man dabbles in the dark arts and you may not catch him for a couple days on end, probably doing something for one of his bajillion clubs. Nobody knows if or when this kid sleeps, but he will give you the name of any collegiate mascot or a late night surprise you probably were wishing not to see. This is 1100 Hill.</p>
