                    <p class="text">11 lads. 11 core friends. Welcome to the most iconic house on campus. This is the Dog House. You've seen us, heard us, and probably almost hit us tossing the football. Now, here's more about us.<br><br/>
                    Encompassing an experience like no other over the course of the last 8 months, this website stands as a testament of the memories and moments we as a house have shared together. Someday we can look back and use these as pages to remember the times we had at 1100 Hill St. and those shared at U-M in general. Enjoy the visit into the 1100 Hill House, #HooksOut.</p>

                    <p class="text"> Being the last semester here for all of us in the fantastic city of Ann Arbor, there has been no shortage of dark arts that we have been getting up to. 
                        The <a href="about.html">about</a> page will inform you more on the happenings of this year from our house, capturing some of our funniest narratives as a team. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, if you want direct information on who is in 1100 Hill, the <a href="roster.html">roster</a> page allows the public and readers like you to find out who is on this dream team, some of the stats behind these one-of-a-kind talents and what you might find them doing on a given day.</p>

                    <p class="text">Every house on the lively U-M Ann Arbor campus has reason to believe they're something out of the ordinary. Yet, few can match what 1100 Hill gets up to on the regular.
                        From some of the wildest things you may see going on in the front yard, to top-notch cooking and the best Uber Eats deliveries one can rationalize, something always seems to be brewing with the guys in 1100.<br/><br/>Another reason why 1100 and the current 2023 crew that's in there must be documented is because of what they'll be up to in the future. From guys pursuing PhD programs to moving all across the US - from Texas to New York - there is something in store for everyone who may be interested in 1100 Hill daily happenings.</p>
